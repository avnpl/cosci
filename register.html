        <h4>What is Cosci?</h4>
        <p>
            Cosci is a figment of imagination of the creator of the site. He just wanted to practice CSS.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="posts right">
        <h4>What does Cosci mean?</h4>
        <p>
            The name was actually derived from the name of a book, Computer Science, which was lying around him (The Co from Computer and Sci from Science).
        </p>

    <div class="posts left">
        <h4>What are the requirements?</h4>
        <p>
            The requirements for registering are as follows: an internet connection, a computer or a laptop or a mobile device, a browser and basic ability to use your brain which you obviously don't have if you are reading all this.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="posts right">
        <h4>Who all can register?</h4>
        <p>
            If you still had this question after reading the previous answer, you might want to question your point of existence. You also clearly don't meet the last requirement.
